# codewit.us roadmap

This document provides a "roadmap" to help developers navigate the organization of both the code and the website's features.

## Front-end

The `codewit/client` directory contains the react app that drives the front-end.

#### Tailwind Styling Configurations

- All styling configurations for Tailwind are located under `codewit/client/src/tailwind.config.js`

#### Website Icon/Logos

- The site icon, or favicon, which appears in the browser tab, is located under the `/client/public/` directory alongside the logo and hexicon. The icon is currently initialized in `/client/index.html` along with the website title.

## Back-end

The `codewit/api` directory contains the express back-end.
