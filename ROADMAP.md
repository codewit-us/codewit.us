# codewit.us roadmap

This document provides a "roadmap" to help developers navigate the organization of both the code and the website's features.

## Front-end

The `codewit/client` directory contains the react app that drives the front-end.

#### Tailwind Styling Configurations

- All styling configurations for Tailwind are located under `codewit/client/src/tailwind.config.js`

#### Website Icon/Logos

- The site icon, or favicon, which appears in the browser tab, is located under the `codewit/client/public/` directory alongside the logo and hexicon.

## App.tsx

- App.tsx is a file that contains all of the routes of our front-end using react-router. It is located under `codewit/client/src/app/app.tsx`.
  #### Current URLS
  - `/` -> Navigates to Home Page
  - `/read/:uid` -> Navigates to Read Page
  - `/create` -> Navigates to Create Page Which Defaults to Create Demo
  - `/create/exercises` -> Navigates to Create Exercise Page
  - `*` -> Intercepts All Other URLS and displays Error Page

## Home Page

- Located at `codewit/client/src/pages/home.tsx`, the Home Page is currently WIP as progress is made.

## Nav

- Located at `codewit/client/src/componenets/nav.tsx`. It is reponsible for holding the login/logout button, but also navigation to various portions of the site.

## App

- Located at `codewit/client/src/app/app.tsx`. It is responsible for handling login / logout logic, which is passed down to the Navbar.

## Read Page

- Located at `codewit/client/src/pages/read.tsx`, the Read Page showcases the full details of a demo. Users can arrive at this page by selecting a demo on the Home Page or directly via the `/read/:uid` URL, where `uid` corresponds to the demo's unique identifier.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Parsing**: Parses `uid` from the URL to fetch the corresponding demo details.
  - **Display**: Displays comprehensive demo content, including video, exercises, and progress tracking.
- **Components**:
  - **VideoUI Components** (`<VideoPlayer />`, `<VideoHeader />`, `<AuthorTags />`, `<HelpfulLinks />`, `<RelatedDemos />`): For displaying the demo's video content, title, author information, helpful resources, and related demos.
    - Components Located under `../components/videoui/`
  - **CodeBlock Components** (`<Exercises />`, `<CodeBlock />`, `<Progress />`, `<CheckList />`): For presenting associated exercises, an interactive code editor, a progress bar, and a checklist for tracking user progress.
    - Components Located under `../components/codeblock/`

## Create Page

- **Location**: `codewit/client/src/pages/create.tsx`. The Create Page is designed to display both Forms using React Router's `Links` & `Outlets`, enabling the display for `<DemoForm />`, `<ExerciseForm />`, `<ModuleForm />`,`<CourseForm />`,`<ResourceForm />`.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Navigation Between Forms**: Provides users the ability to navigate between the Create Demo, Exercise, Module, Course, and Resource Forms using a dashboard located on the left-hand side of the page. Page is hidden if the user is not an admin and also not signed in.
  - **Creating/Editing/Deleting Forms**: Allows users to create new instances of forms, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.
- **Components**:
  - **DemoForm (`<DemoForm />`)**: This component is responsible for rendering the form used for creating and editing demo information. It encapsulates all the necessary fields and functionalities, including input fields for demo details and submission controls.
  - **ExerciseForm (`<ExerciseForm />`)**: This component is responsible for rendering the page used for creating editing, and deleting courses. It features a Markdown Editor for inputting exercise prompts and other necessary fields and functionalities to create exercises. 
  - **CourseForm (`<CourseForm />`)**: This component is responsible for rendering the page used for creating editing, and deleting courses. It encapsulates all the necessary fields and functionalities, including input fields for course details and submission controls.
  - **ModuleForm (`<ModuleForm />`)**: This component is responsible for rendering the page used for creating editing, and deleting modules. It encapsulates all the necessary fields and functionalities, including input fields for module details and submission controls.
  - **ResourceForm (`<ResourceForm />`)**: This component is responsible for rendering the page used for creating editing, and deleting resources. It encapsulates all the necessary fields and functionalities, including input fields for resource details and submission controls.
    - All pages are located under the same directory as the Create Page and  use components located under `../components/form/` to render various inputs/fields
    - API calls for these forms are located under `codewit/client/src/hooks`

## User Management page

- **Functionality**:
  - The User Management page is supposed to allow **admin** users to promote other users to admins as well
  - URL is also hidden if the user is not an admin or is not signed in.

## Back-end

The `codewit/api` directory contains the express back-end.

- **Postman Collection** at `codewit/api/codewit.postman_collection.json`

### main.ts

- main.ts contains the router for our backend apis that uses express's router. It is located at `codewit/api/src/main.ts`

  **Current routes**

  - /demos - for the creating, reading, updating, and deleting the demos
  - /exercises - for the creating, reading, updating, and deleting the exercises

### models

- The `codewit/api/src/models` directory contains the models for the database. These are essentially the schemas for the tables in the database.

  **Current models**

  - demo.ts - for the demo model
  - exercise.ts - for the exercise model
  - language.ts - for the language model
  - tag.ts - for the tag model

### controllers

- The `codewit/api/src/controllers` directory contains the controllers for the routes. These have methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the rows of corresponding tables in the database and are called by the routes.

  **Current controllers**

### lib/shared/validations

- The `codewit/lib/shared/validations/src/lib` directory contains the validation schemas for the models. These are used to validate the data sent in the http request body whenever we try to create/update rows in the db. We also export interfaces that can be used by the frontend for autocompletion and type checking.

  **Current validation schemas**
